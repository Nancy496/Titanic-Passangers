# Titanic-Passangers
## Predicting Wheather passangers on the Titanic would have survived or not from the Train and Test datasets.

## Background:
     The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in
     the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its
     maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224
     passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the
     deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS
     Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of
     three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built
    by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in
    the disaster.

      1.Importing the libraries
      2.Getting the data sets.
      3.Droping the cabin Feature.
      4.Doing the data Exploration/Analysis.
      5.Describing the training dataset.
      6.Cleaning the dataset.
      7.Displaying the head upto 10 rows.
      8.Converting the features into numerals so that machine learning algorithms can process them.
      9.Sporting additional features with missing (NaN=not a number) fill them in.
      10.determine the Age and sex of Passengers.
      11.Determining the class of passanger(1,2 and 3rd class and their survival rates) 
      12.Creating categories based on Age.
      13.Doing the same as for Fare as you did for Age on #12 
      14.Building the machine model and compare the results.We need to use the predictions on the training set to compare the        algorithms with each other and use the cross validation.
      a)Doing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDG):
      b)Doing a Random Forest
      c)Doing a logistic Regression
      d)Doing a K Nearest Neighbour 
      e)Doing a Gaussian Naive Bayes 

      f)Doing a support Vector Machine 

      g)Doing a perceptron 

      h)Doing a Decision Tress 
      i)Doing a Linear regression 

   ## Concluding the best Model.
      my conclusion Gradient Boosting Classifier is the best.This is because Gradient boosting is a greedy algorithm and can overfit a training dataset quickly. It can benefit from regularization methods that penalize various parts of the algorithm and generally improves the performance of the algorithm by reducing overfitting.
