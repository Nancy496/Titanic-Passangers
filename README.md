# Titanic-Passangers
## Predicting Wheather passangers on the Titanic would have survived or not from the Train and Test datasets.
## Contents:
      1.Import the libraries![libraries_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75600702/117049142-2ea7b680-acea-11eb-8087-bc9bcc3133ce.PNG)

      2.Get the data sets![Train-Describe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75600702/117049645-ca392700-acea-11eb-80f1-f432419448e9.PNG)

      3.Drop the passangerId
      4.Do the data Exploration/Analysis
      5.Describe the training dataset
      6.Clean the dataset
      7.Display the head upto 10 rows
      8.Convert the features into numerals so that machine learning algorithms can process them.
      9.Sport additional features with missing (NaN=not a number) fill them in.
      10.determine the Age and sex of Passengers.
      11.Determine the class of passanger(1,2 and 3rd class and their survival rates) 
      12.Create categories based on Age
      13.Do the same as for Fare as you did for Age on #12
      14.Build the machine model and compare the results.We need to use the predictions on the training set to compare the algorithms with each other and use the cross validation.
      a)Do Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDG):
      b)Do a Random Forest
      c)Do a logistic Regression
      d)Do a K Nearest Neighbour 
      e)Do a Gaussian Naive Bayes 
      f)Do a support Vector Machine 
      g)Do a perceptron 
      h)Do a Decision Tress
   ## Conclude the best Model.
